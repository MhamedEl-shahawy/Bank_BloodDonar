                        Many potential blood donors believe that they can’t donate blood due to medical or other
                        reasons. But whether you’ve heard or read information about donation restrictions or been turned
                        down in the past, please do not self defer. You may be able to say “Yes I can!” and share your
                        power through blood donation. If you have questions about any of the subjects below, please
                        contact us for more information.

                            O- has an amazing power to save anyone in need of a blood transfusion. Donors with this
                            powerful blood type are called the universal donor because their red blood cells can be
                            transfused into any patient, regardless of the recipient’s blood type. Only 7% of the
                            population has O- blood, yet it is the blood type in the highest demand.
                            When seconds count, emergency room doctors often do not have time to determine the blood
                            type of the patient and will depend on O- blood to help save the person’s life. O- blood is
                            also vital for premature babies and cancer patients.

                            O+ is the most common blood type and that is what makes it so powerful.
                            37% of the population has O+ blood. Since more people have O+ blood than any other blood
                            type, it is transfused more often.
                            Having the most popular blood puts O+ donors in a unique situation. Their red blood cells
                            are needed and so too are their platelets. This reality means O+ donors have three different
                            donation options.

                            A+ is a powerful blood type because it is the second most common blood type. Since 36% of

                            The most powerful part of A+ blood can be found in the platelets. Platelets can be donated
                            as often as every seven days and up to 24 times a year. Platelets are in high demand by
                            hospitals and often help cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
                            Red blood cells from A+ donors also hold lifesaving power. Depending on hospital demand, a
                            OneBlood phlebotomist will advise you if a whole blood donation is preferred.
