          <p>
            Your generous donations help the patients in our community, from
            children to adults, and help ensure that lifesaving blood products
            are available when they are needed most.
          </p>
          <h4>What happens after I donate?</h4>
          <p>
            Your donation history and future appointment schedule will be
            maintained within this secure Donor Portal, making it easier for you
            to keep track of your donations, make needed changes or view test
            results and other information specific to you.
          </p>

          does not display these results. You may request these results from
          your donor specialists at the time of your donation. Where would you
